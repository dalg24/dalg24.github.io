# Abstract:
State-of-the-art engineering and science codes have grown in complexity
dramatically over the last two decades. Application teams have adopted more
sophisticated development strategies, leveraging third party libraries,
deploying comprehensive testing, and using advanced debugging and profiling
tools. In today’s environment of diverse hardware platforms, these applications
also desire performance portability—avoiding the need to duplicate work for
various platforms. The Kokkos Ecosystem provides that portable software stack.
Based on the Kokkos Core Programming Model, the Ecosystem provides math
libraries, interoperability capabilities with Python and Fortran, and Tools for
analyzing, debugging, and optimizing applications. In this article, we overview
the components, discuss some specific use cases, and highlight how codesigning
these components enables a more developer friendly experience.
