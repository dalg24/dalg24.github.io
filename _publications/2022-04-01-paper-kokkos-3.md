# Abstract:
As the push towards exascale hardware has increased the diversity of system
architectures, performance portability has become a critical aspect for
scientific software. We describe the Kokkos Performance Portable Programming
Model that allows developers to write single source applications for diverse
high-performance computing architectures. Kokkos provides key abstractions for
both the compute and memory hierarchy of modern hardware. We describe the novel
abstractions that have been added to Kokkos version 3 such as hierarchical
parallelism, containers, task graphs, and arbitrary-sized atomic operations to
prepare for exascale era architectures. We demonstrate the performance of these
new features with reproducible benchmarks on CPUs and GPUs.
