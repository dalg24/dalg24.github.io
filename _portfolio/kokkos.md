I've been deeply involved with the [Kokkos project](https://kokkos.org) for
over 7 years, starting as a user in 2017, contributing bug fixes, and then
joining the development team in 2019.  For the past 5+ years, I've co-led the
project, overseeing the development of crucial backends that power the first
exascale supercomputers: Frontier, Aurora, and El Capitan.  Kokkos empowers
hundreds of applications to run efficiently from laptops to the world's fastest
supercomputers, thanks to the dedicated efforts of a multi-institutional team
spanning DOE and international labs. I'm incredibly proud of the team's
achievements and the impact Kokkos has on the HPC landscape.
