The scientific software ecosystem is crucial for advancing research across all
domains.  Through my involvement with [CASS](https://cass.community), I
contribute to enhancing the quality and interoperability of this ecosystem.
Specifically, as the liaison for programming systems, I focus on ensuring that
critical tools like Kokkos, which enable performance portability on exascale
systems, seamlessly integrate with other essential software components.  This
work helps maximize the impact of ECP and ASCR-funded software on the
scientific community.
