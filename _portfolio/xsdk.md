As part of the [Exascale Computing Project
(ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org), I contributed to the development of
[xSDK](https://xsdk.info), a project designed to facilitate the integration of
diverse software packages for exascale applications.  This work involved
developing and promoting [community package
policies](https://xsdk.info/policies/) to improve software interoperability and
sustainability across different development teams and institutions.  The xSDK
plays a crucial role in enabling breakthrough modeling and simulation solutions
for critical US challenges.
