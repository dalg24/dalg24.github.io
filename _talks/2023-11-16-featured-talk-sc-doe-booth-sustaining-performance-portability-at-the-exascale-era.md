Thrilled to share the Kokkos team's vision for exascale computing at
[SC23](https://sc23.supercomputing.org)!
Christian and I presented at the [DOE
Booth](https://scdoe.info/featured-talks/), discussing how Kokkos is empowering
applications to reach new heights of performance.


# Abstract:
We have entered the exascale era of high-performance computing (HPC), and with
it comes the challenge of writing software that can achieve high performance on
a wide variety of heterogeneous architectures. The Kokkos Ecosystem is a
performance portability solution which addresses that challenge through a
single source C++ programming model that follows modern software engineering
practices. Accompanied by a suite of libraries for fundamental computational
algorithms as well as tools for profiling and debugging, Kokkos is a productive
framework to write sustainable software. Today Kokkos arguably provides the
leading non-vendor provided programming model for HPC exascale applications.
Developed and maintained by a multi-institutional team of HPC experts, Kokkos
is relied on by scientist and engineers from well over 100 institutions to help
them leverage modern HPC systems. This talk will provide an overview of Kokkos
and its benefits for performance portability and software sustainability. We
will also present the Kokkosâ€™ team vision for a community driven future of the
project.
