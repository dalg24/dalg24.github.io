I was invited to present at the prestigious, invitation-only SOS27 workshop,
themed "Fostering Innovation at Scale Beyond the Flops." My presentation,
"Sustainable HPC Software: Lessons from the Trenches (A Maintainer's
Perspective)," contributed to the session on "HPC Software Sustainability and
Stewardship." I shared firsthand experiences and insights gained from
maintaining and leading the Kokkos project for over five years, addressing the
critical challenges and solutions in ensuring the longevity and effectiveness
of HPC software in today's rapidly evolving landscape.
