[Christian](https://github.com/crtrott) and I had the pleasure of presenting a
one-day Kokkos tutorial at Kyushu University in Japan.  The workshop was
organized by the HPC OSS[^1] group of the PC Cluster Consortium (PCCC). You can
find more details about the workshop on the PCCC website:

After the tutorial, we had the opportunity to tour the university's
supercomputing center, including their GENKAI system, which features a couple
partitions equipped with NVIDIA H100 GPUs.
