I presented remotely a short introduction to Kokkos at PPPL's Center for
Advanced Computation Tutorials.  PPPL is renowned for its work on
[XGC](https://xgc.pppl.gov/), a gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code crucial for
simulating the edge region of magnetically confined thermonuclear fusion
plasmas.  XGC utilizes Kokkos and [Cabana](https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana)
to achieve high performance on leadership-class supercomputers.
