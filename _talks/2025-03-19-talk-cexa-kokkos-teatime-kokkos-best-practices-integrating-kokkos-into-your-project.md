I was pleased to present a session on "Kokkos Best Practices" as part of the
[CExA Kokkos Tea-Time](https://kokkos.org/community/tea-time/) talk series.
This talk focused on practical strategies for effectively integrating Kokkos
into projects using CMake. I discussed key considerations such as managing
Kokkos through external installations versus in-project builds, and provided
detailed guidance on the recommended initialization and finalization procedures
for Kokkos within libraries and applications. This session aimed to equip
developers with the tools and knowledge necessary to leverage Kokkos
efficiently and effectively in their work.
