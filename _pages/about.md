Hello! I'm Damien Lebrun-Grandi√©, a Computational Scientist at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. For over a decade, I've been driven by the exciting
possibilities of scientific computing and the collaborative spirit of the
open-source world. Leading the [Kokkos project](https://kokkos.org) and
contributing to the [C++ standard](https://isocpp.org/std) or the [High
Performance Software Foundation](https://hpsf.io) are just a few of the ways I
strive to empower researchers worldwide.
